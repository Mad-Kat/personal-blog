## What is TOTP?

TOTP is an extension of the HMAC-based One-Time Password (HOTP) algorithm. It combines a secret key with the current time to generate a unique, short-lived password. This time-based approach adds an extra layer of security by ensuring that each password is valid only for a limited time.
